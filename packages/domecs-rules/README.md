# @domecs/rules

A small, safe, data-defined expression language and rule interpreter for
DOMECS (M6).

- `parseExpression` — a Pratt parser turning a tiny expression grammar into
  an `AstNode`. Never throws; syntax errors come back as `{ errors:
  ParseError[] }` with an accurate character `position`.
- `evaluate` — a pure, world-agnostic evaluator (`AstNode` + `EvalEnv` →
  `number | string | boolean`).
- `compileRule` / `installRules` — the world-facing layer that resolves a
  `RuleDef` (JSON-shaped: `query`, `when`, `actions`) against real
  `@domecs/core` component types and installs it as a `world.system(...)`.

See inline doc comments in `src/evaluator.ts` and `src/rules.ts` for the
documented behavior around missing fields (skip-this-entity) and determinism
(`random()` is wired to the per-tick `ctx.rand.uniform()`, never
`Math.random`).
